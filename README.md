# world-cup-2022
This project connects to a football database, gets data about the World Cup 2022 and displays the matches info in a webpage. 

In this study I practised: 
- Connecting to API and getting data
- Treating the data and saving to Django database
- Writting views logic to display the data in a webpage
- Using HTML and CSS to display the info.
